# Time-Based Animation Project

## Project Description
This project is a creative time-based animation inspired by Pacita Abad's "Wheels of Fortune" artwork. It features 15 animated wheels with dynamic chains that respond to time-based events and transformations.

## Features
- **15 Animated Wheels**: Each with unique colors, patterns, and rotation speeds
- **Dynamic Chains**: Pulsing chains that connect the wheels with colorful beads
- **Time-Based Animation**: Smooth animations driven by trigonometric functions and timers
- **Multiple Variants**: Three different wheel decoration styles (A, B, C)
- **Interactive Elements**: Continuously evolving visual patterns

## Technical Details
- Built with **p5.js** library
- Uses time-based animation principles
- Features smooth rotations, pulsations, and color transitions
- Responsive design that works in modern web browsers

## File Structure
project-folder
- index.html # Main HTML file
- sketch.js # Main animation code
- style.css # Styling file
- jsconfig.json # JavaScript configuration
- README.md # This file


## Installation & Usage

## Customization
You can modify the following parameters in `sketch.js`:
- `R`: Wheel radius
- `BEAD_W`: Chain bead width  
- `CHAIN_GAP`: Gap between wheels and chains
- Colors and patterns in individual wheel definitions

## How to Run in VS Code
1. Open VS Code
2. File → Open Folder → Select your project folder
3. Right-click on `index.html` in the file explorer
